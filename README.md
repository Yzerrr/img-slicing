Mailplus Parse Image

To ensure that the individual images arrive in a well-positioned position in various mail clients when the mail is opened, they are sent in a table.

The image is pre-sliced in photoshop. Then the user has to make an html table himself so that the sliced images become one again.
Creating this table takes time. And does not always goes right the first time.

Based on the total width of the image, a table is now generated for you.
